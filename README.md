# Edmonton-Food-Drive-Clustering
In this project, we use the data collected from the Food Drive 2023 and apply clustering techniques to identify the neighborhoods that contribute the most to donation bags. Algorithms like K-Means or hierarchical clustering are used to find natural groupings within the data.
